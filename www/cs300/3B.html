The feeding of Tigress Macchli in her last few years
</h2>
	The tiger legend Macchli, the oldest tiger(ess) passed away last month at a ripe old age of 20. The news shocked many across the globe. The tigress's passing away, however, was also a relief to many - it was but a sad sight to watch the once mighty tigress reduced to such a pathetic state.
<p>
	The tigress gained her fame after her well-known fight where she killed a  14-foot long crocodile. 
Called the 'Lady of the Lakes' she captured most of the territory around the three iconic lakes at Ranthambore National Park. 
aving raised 11 cubs, it is said that half the population of the park is of her lineage.
<p>	
	Most tigers live for an age of 10-15 years. Macchli, on the other hand, lived much longer, thanks to the efforts of the forest department at Ranthambore that were providing her with baits for the last seven years. 
With the USD 10 million that she earned due to tourist attraction for India, it seemed justified go to such means to keep her alive, but the answer is still not satisfactory.
<p>	
	Some conservationists believe that, wild animals must live and die naturally. 
This is important or else we may end up taming them, which can cause a serious harm to wildlife.
 Without the baits offered to her Macchli would have died much earlier.
 But just keeping her alive in a pathetic state, some say, is keeping her alive artificially. Towards the end of her days Macchli lost sight in one eye and all of her canines. She was driven out of her last patch of territory by her daughter Sundari. Keeping her alive in such a state is not how it works in the wild.
<p>	
	Finally, it is a race between pride and money on one side and good living on the other. The division is but a thin line.
