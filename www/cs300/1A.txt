The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey

	A must watch, excellent scenes, wonderful sound effects and nice comedy. Though I would say, it has some major mistakes. Starting with the introduction, it is unecessarily long and boring at points. The dwarves do not need to throw dishes around for minutes, and there is no need to keep on showing the filty ways of dwarves for another few minutes. The Brown wizard is quite funny. As we go ahead, the sound and videographic effects are excellent when the company is attacked by orcs on wargs. Its just amazing. The tricks that Bilbo uses on the trolls are quite amusing and comic too. However, these tricks can get you mad after a while because these people get saved at the last moment of every situation they fall into. Funny that they get away from the orcs, the trolls, and hundreds of goblins without even a broken bone (forget death), not to mention huge rocks crashing down on them.
	And there are childish things to add to them, rock giants fighting against each other is the limit. Its boring. But then it all changes when Bilbo falls inside Golllum's cave. The character Gollum is itself one of a creation. Kudos to the writer and the physical makers of the character. Not to mention the end of the movie where the to-be dwarf king Thorin is saved by Bilbo. Though they soil it again up when Gandalf calls the eagles send a message through a butterfly. That's the edge of fantasy, seems to feel like a fairy tale. But this wont spoil it for you as thats not the real end. It matters that the heroes win.
	But overall, wonderful characters, wonderful story and to mention again wonderful effects...
