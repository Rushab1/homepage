==Grey Hornbills ==

These medium sized grey birds with a large black beak can be seen quite often in pairs of two. The beak has a horn-like protrusion on the top which gives the bird its name. An interesting fact about these birds is that the female seals herself within the nest with the eggs, and the male feeds the female until the eggs hatch when the seal is broken. Generally these birds are spotted high in the trees.
